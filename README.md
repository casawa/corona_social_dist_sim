# Virus Social Distancing Simulator

### Purpose
Social distancing is very important to containing COVID-19.
But admittedly at first the risk might not seem that high.

This simulation aims for people to make decisions of social
distancing or not and seeing the consequences of their
actions to better understand risk.

Doing this since I didn't see such a simulation and wondering
if an interactive way that really helps grapple the decisions
they'll need to make in real life anyway is useful.

### The External Pitch
Every day, with the information you have, you have a choice: Should you leave your home and continue your regular routine or not?

Everyone else also has this choice and may think similar to what you’re thinking — in this simulation, they think the exact same way you do.

**Note**: This is not a scientific simulation to be trusted for any reason! It is purely for illustrative purposes.

### Dev
#### Web App
- Start up a web server with `python3 -m http.server`
- Open up `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
#### CLI
- With node >= v13 simply run: `node ./main.js` to run the javascript simulation
- Initially started with a  CLI python prototype which can be run by `python3 ./prototyping/sim.py`
