    <p> Every day, with the information you have, you have a choice:<br />
      - Should you leave your home and continue your regular routine, or stay at home?
      <br /><br />
      Everyone else also has this choice and information, and may think similar to what you're thinking. In this simulation, they think the exact same way you do. So if you're leaning 30% to stay at home, so is everyone else.
      <br /><br />
      What are the long-term consequencies of this thinking as the virus spreads?
