      <p> Each day, with the information you have, you have a choice:<br />
        - Should you leave home and do your regular routine, or stay at home?
        <br /><br />
        Everyone else also has this choice and information, and may think similar to what you're thinking -- and your choice likely influences theirs. In this simulation, they think the exact same way you do. So if you think there's a small risk and have a 10% chance of staying at home, everyone else is also thinking as such.
        <br /><br />
        What are the long-term consequences of this thinking as the virus spreads?
        <br /><br />
